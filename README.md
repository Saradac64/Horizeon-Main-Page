# Code Refactor Starter Code

> Outline: The Horiseon project required me to refactor the code of a marketing agency in order to optimize it for search engines and to make it easier to read the code.
Some of the changes I made was providing alternate div tags and comments to better display what each section exactly is. The html code did not need any alterations as the web page was displaying correctly. The title did need to be changed and was changed to "Horiseon Main Page".
